# C# Technical Questionnaire

This is a list of questions that you will most likely be asked on formal assessments as part of the Alpha program as well as on technical interviews during your job application process. Regard these questions as your personal learning guide as well as an accurate measurement of your knowledge and understanding of fundamental technical topics. The questions are separated into two groups:

**1.   The first group are questions that we expect you know the answer of in great details and could answer and explain additional questions regarding them. These questions are related to the material we have covered during our classes.**

**2.   The second set consists of questions that we expect you to know about and can give a basic answer, without diving deep into the subject. These questions are usually based on additional resources we provide inside the Learning Management System. You should research those topics in your spare time.**
