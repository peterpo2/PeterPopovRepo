Design and implement a Forum System, where the users can create posts, add
comments, and upvote/downvote the things that they like or dislike the most.
Choose what your forum will be about and stick with it. Examples: an automotive
fanbase forum, java technical learning forum, crypto trading forum, fashion forum,
etc. The forum should revolve around one or two general topics.
