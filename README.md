From March to September, I dedicated myself to mastering a diverse set of skills at Telerik Academy. Successfully completing the program, I now boast a comprehensive knowledge base that includes proficiency in C#, SQL, MSTest, MVC, ASP.Net Core, HTML, CSS, and React. This journey also saw me applying my skills during a rewarding three-month internship. Notably, I independently undertook and completed the solo project "AptekaSoftware." This experience has not only broadened my technical expertise but has also equipped me with practical, hands-on experience in the field. Excited to leverage these skills and contribute meaningfully in future endeavors!
