1. Order class is introduced
  Pros:
   - We can now create instances of Order which will all have the same properties.
   - Code becomes more readable
  Cons:
   - Still no exact rules - we can still create orders without the needed parameters - For example, what happens if we create an order but forget to set it's recipient?
