1. Interface IOrder introduced. Both InternationalOrder and IOrder implements it.
  Pros:
   - We can now invoke IOrder methods without worrying what is the implementation underneath. 
   - This allows us to remove the second collection for InternationalOrders and create one single collection of type IOrder.
   - We can now pass IOrder as a parameter to a method instead of an exact implementation.
  Cons:
   - n/a
