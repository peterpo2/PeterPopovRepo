1. Order class constructor introduced
  Pros:
   - We now have certain rules in place when creating order.
   - We can't create order without the required parameters within our constructor.
   - Makes our program less prone to errors since we can't instantiate objects without the required params
  Cons:
   - Lots of functionality is still in our Program.cs file. Various operations on Order's data is best kept inside the class itself.
